# Color-Demosaicing-for-Digital-Cameras
Implemented a linear regression-based algorithm to digitally restore RAW images captured by digital cameras by predicting missing color components using the Bayer Pattern. The resulting code yields a lower RMSE error than the built-in MATLAB demosaic() function.
